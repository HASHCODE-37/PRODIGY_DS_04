# PRODIGY_DS_04
This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on textual data using Python libraries such as NLTK's Vader for sentiment analysis and Pandas for data manipulation. This code is part of my fourth task during my internship.

Overview
sentiment_analysis.py: This Python script demonstrates how to conduct sentiment analysis on a dataset using NLTK's Vader sentiment intensity analyzer and Pandas DataFrame for data management.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
nltk
Usage
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Modify the sample data in the script or replace it with your own dataset.
Run the script to perform sentiment analysis and visualize the sentiment scores.
Sample Data
The sample data used in this script includes:

ID: Unique identifier for each entry.
Topic: The topic or category of the text.
Sentiment: Initially labeled sentiment (Positive/Neutral) which is later replaced with sentiment scores.
Text: Textual content for sentiment analysis.
Sentiment Analysis Process
Data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
NLTK's Vader SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is initialized.
Sentiment analysis is performed on the text data using Vader, and sentiment scores (compound score) are added to the DataFrame.
The sentiment scores are plotted against the index to visualize the sentiment trends.

requirements.txt: List of required libraries.
Feel free to explore and modify the code for your own sentiment analysis tasks or as part of learning NLTK and Pandas for text analysis projects.
